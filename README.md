# mailbox-runtime-js

A minimal mailbox-based runtime for actor-style, message-driven services — designed for teams before adopting pub/sub systems.

## Status

Early design phase. Documentation-first. No runtime implementation yet.

## What this is

- A mailbox-based execution model
- Actor-style message handling
- HTTP-friendly (ingress only)
- Pre–pub/sub architecture layer

## What this is not

- Not a framework
- Not a pub/sub system
- Not a workflow engine
- Not a replacement for Kafka or NATS

## Runtime compatibility

- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- Node.js 16 (compatibility mode)

## Philosophy

Discipline over convenience.  
Clarity over cleverness.  
Boring runtime behavior over magic.

- Conceptual docs: /docs
